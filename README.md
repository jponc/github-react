# Github Search

1. Bootstrapped project with CRA with TypeScript
2. Removed unnecessary files and used my personal file structure
3. Added material-ui so it'll look nice somehow
4. Added router (Maybe not necessary but it opens an opportunity to extend the project)
5. Added global app layout
6. Implemented search bar using controlled component with onSearch callback
7. Check how to use Github API
8. Added Repository and Owner to types
9. Added ability to fetch repositories via Github Search API
10. Added repositories as part of the global app context
11. Added fetch repositories initially as part of the layout (TODO: Change this to only fetch in list screen)
